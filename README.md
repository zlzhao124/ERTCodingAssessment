# ERTCodingAssessment

All the code and other files associated with the code should be inside the repository and named accordingly. 

Assessment IRI EDP: files created are ```IRICpgm.c```, ```IRIDocumentation.txt```, ```IRIGnucommands.txt```, and ```IRImakefile.txt```. See ```IRIDocumentation.txt``` on more information about that.

Assessment Coordinate Transformation: file created is ```convertRadarGIS.c```

Assessment Interpolation: file created is ```LonLatInterpolation.py```

Assessment Temporal Relationship: files created are ```sortDateTime.py``` and ```sortDateTime.c```. I tried programming it in C but ran into a standstill because I got stuck trying to parse in the "---" values, which converted to 0.000 and forced the rest of the line to also be 0.000. I couldn't find a way to get around this in a feasible amount of time, so I just continued coding as if my parsed file had the correct numbers, meaning I still tried my best to sort and find the medians with the wrong data that I parsed in from the file. 
This is also why I did the assignment in Python, a language I'm more familiar with because I was successfully able to do all the tasks in Python. For both I didn't use any external liberary except for the datetime package in Python.

Assessment Javascript: file created is ```HTML_JSproblem.html```

Assessment: Optimization: file created is TBD
