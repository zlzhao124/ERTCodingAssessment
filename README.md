# ERTCodingAssessment

All the code and other files associated with the code should be inside the repository and named accordingly. 

Assessment IRI EDP: files created are ```IRICpgm.c```, ```IRIDocumentation.txt```, ```IRIGnucommands.txt```, and ```IRImakefile.txt```. See ```IRIDocumentation.txt``` on more information about that.

Assessment Coordinate Transformation: file created is ```convertRadarGIS.c```

Assessment Interpolation: file created is ```LonLatInterpolation.py```

Assessment Temporal Relationship: files created are ```sortDateTime.py``` and ```sortDateTime.c```. I tried programming it in C but ran into a standstill because I got stuck trying to parse in the "---" values, which converted to 0.000 and forced the rest of the line to also be 0.000. I couldn't find a way to get around this in a feasible amount of time, so I decided to stop and switch to coding the assignment in Python, a language I'm more familiar with. I was successfully able to do all the tasks in Python. For both I didn't use any external liberary except for the datetime package in Python. 
Because I was able to implement a correct sorting algorithm and a correct median-finiding algorithm in Python, I omit the implementation in C because I hope that my work in Python clearly knows that I know how to implement them in general. Switching from Python to C is just a syntax problem more than anything, which I can always learn on the job.

Assessment Javascript: file created is ```HTML_JSproblem.html```

Assessment: Optimization: still in the process of thinking of a good way to code this up, but my ideas are written in ```OptimizationIdea.txt```
